## Detailed Functionality

:::

<ContentBlock title="Detailed Functionality">

> - Divination: The bot initiates by engaging in divination activities, specifically targeting pale wisps. It moves the player to the Energy Rift, configures it, and starts harvesting pale wisps. It monitors the inventory and converts memories when the backpack is full, ensuring continuous collection of resources.

> - Grand Exchange Interactions: Once sufficient pale energy is collected, the bot navigates to the Grand Exchange (GE). It handles interactions with the GE clerks to sell the collected pale energy and other items, like roses, to accumulate gold pieces (GP). The bot also manages the tutorial for new players at the GE.

> - Item Purchasing: With accumulated GP, the bot intelligently purchases necessary items such as Rings of Duelling, Skills Necklaces, and Supercompost from the GE, ensuring that the player is always equipped for subsequent tasks.

> - Farming: The script transitions to farming activities once the necessary items are procured. It navigates to designated farming areas, turns manure for leveling up farming skills, and uses supercompost to enhance the growth of plants. It handles the collection and selling of roses, including the more valuable golden roses.

> - Banking: The bot efficiently manages banking tasks at Hets Oasis, loading presets and withdrawing essential items to prepare for farming activities. It ensures that the player's inventory is optimally managed for continuous operations.

> - World Hopping: To maximize efficiency, the script includes a world-hopping feature that allows the player to switch worlds to avoid crowded areas and ensure access to resources.

> -  Purchasing and Usage: Once enough GP is amassed, the bot proceeds to buy Bonds from the GE. It carefully monitors the market, adjusts bid prices, and completes the purchase. After obtaining the Bonds, the script handles their redemption, adding them to the player's account.

> - Event Handling: The script is equipped to handle various game events, such as inventory updates and chat messages. It responds to these events by adjusting the botâ€™s state and actions, ensuring smooth and adaptive operation.

## My Recommendation

:::

<ContentBlock title="My Recommendation">

> - Use the auto login module from BWU incase you get kicked offline while changing worlds
> - Bot on fresh account rather than old ones
> - Use a username that doesnt look auto generated
> - If collecting bond codes, if you get banned check the mail and the codes should still be there
