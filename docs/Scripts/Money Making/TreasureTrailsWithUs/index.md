<ContentBlock title="Features">

> - Solves any tier of clue scroll easy (~40+/hr)/medium(~30+/hr)/hard(~20+/hr)/elite(10+/hr)/master(10+/hr).
> - Above estimates will vary and depend on your preset (You can start the script with literarly nothing or a full inventory of teleport items)
> - Locates and excavates powered tetracompasses.
> - For emote clues you can either have a hidey hole built/filled for that step OR have the items in bank OR Allow using emote skipping tickets in settings & have skipping tickets in preset.
> - If you have a hidey hole built but not filled it will fill that hidey hole for you assuming you have the items required to fill it in bank.
> - At any point if your character is too low on hp (below 40%) it will use war's retreat teleport spell & heal at the bank.
> - The bot will stop if it doesn't have any more clues to solve / No_Path was found for a step / No required Items/Levels/Quests for a step.
> - If the script is stopping it will teleport you to war's retreat & logout / simply just stop depending if logout option is checked in settings.
> - Uses the effects of globetrotter outfit:
> - - If you have the full outfit worn in your preset & hidey hole filled will skip equipping clue items before using the emote.
> - - if you have globetrotter jacket in your inventory/equipment it will teleport to current clue if it has charges and its a scan clue/ the path to clue takes longer than ~70 seconds.
> - - if you have globetrotter backpack in your inventory/equipment it will skip the step if it has charges and no path was found to current clue or an annoying master skilling clue.

## Requirements

:::
<ContentBlock title="Requirements/Instructions">

> - First of all have a weapon of your choice worn in your preset & have a revo bar for it (Any weapons will do).
> - War's retreat teleport unlocked (if you don't have it unlocked go kill 10 kbds and buy the unlock from war shop).
> - Have equipment & inventory tabs open & in view at all times.
> - Have Magic spellbook open at all times.
> - Before starting the script make sure to withdraw your current active clue from bank (active clues shouldn't be in your preset only sealed ones/ charos' clue carrier)
> - For scan clues (elites/masters) you need to disable walk markers from settings.
> - Have emotes tab open & in view at all times (I'd just make it as small as possible and tuck it somewhere on screen).
> - If use meerkats option is on you need to have meerkats pouch & scrolls in your preset.
> - If no path was found for a step you need to open that clue and see what your missing probably either a light source or trollhiem access (If no spell to teleport to trollhiem was found you need to have rock climbing boots in your inventory/equipment).
> - If your doing tetracompasses simply have any amount of them (powered) in your inventory and start the script.
