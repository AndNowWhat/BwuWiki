<summary>UI Settings Guide</summary>

This is an example of a possible T90 UI setup.

All recommended settings are optional, but lead to dps increase or qol increase. Use them if you can.

1. If you have T90 weapon/lantern, use this option. The bot will do the T90 dps rotation.
2. (Recommended) If you have the limitless ability codex unlocked, check this and the bot will use limitless for reflect in P4.
3. (Highly Recommended) If you have the undead slayer codex unlocked, the bot will incorporate it into its rotation.
4. (Highly Recommended) Enable this option to cast the Invoke death incantation. If you are wearing t90 deathdealer robes, this effect will apply automatically. If not, check the box to apply it so Rasial dies with 30k health left.
5. (Recommended) Use the ingenuity of the humans codex (Required for smoke cloud to hit, if using smoke cloud)
6. (Recommended) Use smoke cloud at the start of fight for increased crit chance (Requires ingenuity of humans codex)
7. (Recommended) Throw a 2nd vulnerability bomb after the first one runs out. Will increase kill times marginally.
8. (Recommended) Lantadyme sticks will mean your overload doses are 2minutes longer each!
9. Enable this if you don't have passive ring of vigour effect unlocked. You need a ring of vigour in your preset in this case. Passive effect recommended.
10. (Highly recommended) Cast prism of restoration ancient magic spell. Heals familiar + restores their special points, meaning the reaver heals you more often.
11. Enable this if for some reason your character isn't making it to the wall for the fight, or you dont want to surge at War's.
12. (Recommended) Requires EOF or conjurer's necklace, swap to it when summoning conjures. Equates to 4%+ dps increase for the fight.
    13 (Recommended) Use the conjurer's necklace for the necklace swap. Only appears if 12 is checked.
